			              		Our Guide-Drivers are by far the best in East Africa, not just for their knowledge and understanding of their country, the wealth of knowledge they possess on the abundant wildlife, flora and fauna and the rich and vibrant cultures of East Africa, but as affable travelling companions. Our guide-drivers understand that in order for our guests’ to fully appreciate the destination they need to spend ‘quality time’ with the wildlife, interact with the local people and marvel at interesting places.

Thus, our guide-drivers will never rush them in order to conclude the program. They will, instead, allow our guests’ ample time to fully enjoy and savour those wonderful moments and take as many photographs as one would wish and will only leave at the behest of their guests. They are in our full time employment and, given that they are our company’s ambassadors, we consider it extremely vital to ‘invest’ in our important human resources. We have regular training sessions for our guide-drivers and have designed a rigorous training curriculum that includes safe driving, safety and comfort of our guests, basic photographic skills to list just a few. This guarantees our guests’ continue to enjoy a memorable visit to our Africa. Besides being fluent in English and Kiswahili (our local language) most of our guide-drivers also speak a third language such as Chinese, French, German, Spanish etc.

We know we have set high standards of service in the industry and are proud that this is not only appreciated by our guests but is also acknowledged by the industry.</p>
